what to do else:

-remove commas from output txt
-See if we can replace exceptions for assert
-30 minutes constants that adds at the fileName in writeFiles
at the constants module
-Check if there are more constants to add, like indexes
-review contracts and add comments



About the report

this is what I would suggest to divide the work, it's not necessarily what each one of us did because some functions as
we saw they were merged, so this could be a possibility:

readFiles.py, writeFiles.py and timeD.py (the ones you made) (total = 12 functions) -> Kinga
organize.py, operations.py, timeD.py (the ones I made) plus the allocate function (total = 10 functions) -> Martim


It is just a brief description saying what they do, maybe it's not necessary to describe all of them, but probably the most
important ones and the 'extras' I would say.

When you can, tell me what you think about this so that we can start to finish :)
